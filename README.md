# BlockUnderRadarJunk
##### A list (in .txt format) of junk for adblockers - Junk the more popular uBlock & Adblock lists missed!

"Junk, You shall not pass!" - Gandalf?

---------------

#### What's in your block list? There's much bigger & better ones out there!

This list contain domains, website elements and similar things that I believe is junk and should be blocked.

It can be malicious domains, spam, popups, redirects, ads. Useless stuff on websites that is annoying.

There's so much junk on the web and new stuff get out there every minute so no filter alone is perfect.
I use several block lists myself with uBlock on Firefox so I know when the more popular
filter lists didn't block something that clearly, or atleast I think, should be blocked.

So, that's what you'll find in this list...
Bad stuff the big block lists missed, junk that went under the radar. ;)

I mostly surf on English and Swedish websites but even if you
never surf on Swedish sites this list will still be useful for you!

If your adblocker or any kind of blocker that you're using can handle more than one filter, use that feature!

Just remember that some filters might cause problems with some websites
that you visit because they block something the website needs to work properly.
