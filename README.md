# BlockUnderRadarJunk
##### A filter list (in .txt format) for blocking junk! - Junk the more popular uBlock, AdBlock & other adblockers lists missed!
"Junk, You shall not pass!" - Gandalf?

---------------

#### What's in your block list? There's much bigger & better ones out there!
This list contain domains, website elements and similar things that I believe is junk and should be blocked.
It can be malicious domains, spam, popups, redirects, ads. Useless stuff on websites that is annoying.

There's so much junk on the web and new stuff get out there every minute so no filter alone is perfect.
I use several block lists myself with uBlock on Firefox so I know when the more popular
filter lists didn't block something that clearly, or atleast I think, should be blocked.
So, that's what you'll find in this list... Bad stuff the big block lists missed, junk that went under the radar. ;)


#### URL to the filter list in txt format
Add this filter URL to uBlock, AdBlock or other compatible blockers:

#### Where can I find a blocker for my web browser?
If you want to install a adblocker, blocker or whatever you call it, I recommend uBlock Origin. Several of the other popular ones have a bad reputation. And if you do some research they have it for a valid reason. Here's links to the uBlock extension/addon for different web browsers.

Google Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm

Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/
