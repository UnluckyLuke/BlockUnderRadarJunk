## BlockUnderRadarJunk (Filter List)
#### This is a filter list for uBlock & Other Compitable AdBlockers.

It contains filters to get rid of Ads, Popups, Malware and similar Junk that other popular block filters didn't block.
BlockUnderRadarJunk works with uBlock, AdBlockPlus among other ad blockers.


#### What's this list blocking? Why would I use it?
This list contain domains, website elements and similar things that I believe is "junk" and should be blocked.
Often it's stuff that haven't yet been added to other filter lists.
It might be malicious domains, spam, popups, redirects, ads, unwanted scripts. In short, junk!

#### Where can I find a ad blocker for my web browser?
If you want to install a adblocker, blocker or whatever you call it, I would recommend uBlock Origin.
