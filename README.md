## BlockUnderRadarJunk - A Filter for uBlock & compitable ad blockers

##### BlockUnderRadarJunk is a ad filter list (in .txt format) for blocking junk! Ads, Popups and similar Junk the more popular uBLock ad filter lists missed!
##### It's a "Experimental" filter list so use at your own risk. If there's a rule that's causing problems I'll try to update or remove it as soon as possible.

#### What's this list blocking? Why would I use it?
This list contain domains, website elements and similar things that I believe is junk and should be blocked.
It can be malicious domains, spam, popups, redirects, ads, unwanted scripts. In short, useless stuff on websites that is annoying.

There's so much junk on the web and new stuff get out there every minute so no filter alone is perfect.
I use several block lists myself with uBlock so I notice when the more popular
filter lists didn't block something that clearly, or atleast I think, should be blocked.
So, that's what you'll find in this list... Bad stuff the big block lists missed, junk that went under the radar. ;)

#### Where can I find a blocker for my web browser?
If you want to install a adblocker, blocker or whatever you call it, I recommend uBlock Origin.
Several of the other popular ones have a bad reputation. And if you do some research they have it for a valid reason.
Here's links to the uBlock Origin extension/addon for different web browsers.

Google Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm

Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/
